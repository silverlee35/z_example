description: |
  Silicon Labs HFRCODPLL peripheral. Can be used as a free-running RC oscillator
  or with PLL lock to HFXO or LFXO. To enable PLL, set the `clocks` property to
  the source xtal oscillator, and set the `dpll-*` options to desired values.

  In PLL mode, `clock-frequency` represents the target PLL frequency.
  In free-running mode, `clock-frequency` represents the HFRCO band to use.
