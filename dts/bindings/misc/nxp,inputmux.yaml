    INPUTMUX attachment or signal enablement.

    For signal enablement, specify the "signal" property and use "MUX_*_ENA"
    constants defined in used device's DT binding for this driver. For example:

    flexcomm12_dma0_rx {
        signal = <MUX_FLEXCOMM12_RX_TO_DMAC0_CH34_REQUEST_ENA>;
    };

    For signal attachment (routing), specify the "selector" and "source"
    properties. The "selector" property specifies which signal is to be
    assigned and the "source" property specifies the source to which the
    assignment will be made. For example:

    dsp_int0 {
       selector = <0>;
       source = <MUX_FLEXCOMM0_TO_DSP_INTERRUPT>;
    };
