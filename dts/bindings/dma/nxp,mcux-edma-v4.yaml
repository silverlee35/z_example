      Describes channel enabled mask value on every IRQ.
      The channel number is mapped to the bit value of array element value.
      If the interrupt is shared on one channel number, the correspongding
      bit is set to 1.
      Please note each element of the array must be 32-bit. If there are more
      than 32 channels, add one or more 32-bit elements in array. The software
      will determine the mask value of several elements corresponding to the
      same interrupt according to the number of channels.
