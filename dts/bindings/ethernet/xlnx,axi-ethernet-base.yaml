# multiple "compatible" properties match the same driver and options

properties:
  interrupts:
    type: array
    description: Xilinx AXI Ethernet has an optional interrupt for updating statistics.
  interrupt-parent:
    type: phandle
    description: Interrupt controller that the DMA is connected to.
  reg:
    type: array
    description: |
      Control registers of the MDIO device are also used for the Ethernet MAC controller.
      Thus, both devices should have a parent node with compatible "xlnx,axi-ethernet-subsystem-7.2"
      which defines the reg property, and MAC and MDIO should NOT have a reg property.
  clocks:
    type: phandle-array
  clock-frequency:
    type: int
  local-mac-address:
    type: uint8-array
    description: Ethernet adapter MAC address.
